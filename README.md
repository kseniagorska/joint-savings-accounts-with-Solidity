# Joint savings accounts -  smart contract using Solidity 
This project automates the creation of joint savings accounts. This Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. Only these two addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. This  smart contract  uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account as well as the ability to view the last account number that withdrew the funds and the amount of the last withdrawal. 

## Technology
